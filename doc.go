// Package blueprint provides a set of interfaces for developing Go
// applications with clean framework design in mind. The package blueprint is a
// "kit" of common framework abstractions. At github.com/blueprint you can also
// find some implimentations for these interfaces. You are always invited to
// write your own implimentations, or plugins for external libraries.
